Have you ever noticed that (evil) face hidden right in the middle of the Debian
logo?

<div class="center">
<img src="/images/evil-face-within-debian-logo.png"
    width="450" height="559"
    loading="lazy"
    alt="Evil face within Debian logo"
    class="bleed" />
</div>

Just turn your head about 45° counterclockwise and see for yourself — it's in
there! Definitely, I should not stare at wallpapers at my computers *that* much.

Few points to justify the title:

* favicon's absence polluted logs and statistics with error 404;
* with favicon it's easier for readers to distinguish my blog in their
  bookmarks or tabs;
* that idea about the face within the logo bothered me for quite some time, and
  now it's time to finally share it with the world, for better or for worse
  (there's always a risk to look silly, y'know).

See ya, folks!
