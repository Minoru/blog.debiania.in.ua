I'm Ukrainian, so English isn't my native language. I started learning it in the
5th grade, but like many other students, I didn't spend too much effort on it.
Sure, it's lingua franca and all that, but honestly, I didn't care. Not even
after I failed an exam in the 10th grade.

Around the same time, I began exploring the world of Linux. You already see where
this is going, right? Of course, I joined a Linux-related channel on Freenode.
Actually, it was more like a gathering place for a ragtag crew, but hey, it had
Linux in the topic and my Linux-related questions got answered, so it's a Linux
channel in my book.

I was a bit of a menace, pestering everyone else to point out my errors, but one
of the guys there, pnbeast, did me one better: he engaged me in long, wandering
conversations about anything and everything. We hit it off: I was curious, and
he was an interesting person and a great interlocutor. I'm not sure what he got
out of those chats, other than an occasional chuckle, but I got the jackpot:
a habit of actually using English. pnbeast bridged the gap between the classroom
and the real world for me, and once I got going, I just never stopped.

Two years later, I finished school with a B in English. Not bad for someone who
was struggling to get passing marks until then, eh? Today, easily half of my
communication happens in English.

There was also this other guy, Raging_Hog. (I didn't appreciate the nickname
until much, much later.) I don't think we chatted all that much, but he too had
a profound impact on me. I was writing scripts for my IRC client and sharing
them via pastebins. Probably annoyed by my spam, Raging_Hog told me about Git
and GitHub, so I could post a single link and quietly update it later.

Anyone who's using Newsboat today is slightly indebted to Raging_Hog.

Perhaps I would've gotten serious about English some other way. Maybe I'd hear
about GitHub a few years later, at the university. It's possible that without
Freenode, I'd end up finding some friends locally. Who knows. The facts are:
Freenode did exist, and all those people were on the network, and I met them,
and they affected me, and I went on to accomplish things.

Thanks, pnbeast. Thanks, Raging_Hog. Thanks, Sulis and Punko and everybody else.
And thank you, Freenode.

(There's an ongoing drama around Freenode; I don't have a good summary to link
to. The upshot is, I'm no longer on there, so if you spot Minoru on Freenode,
that's an impostor. Check [the About page](/about.html) for where else you can
find me.)
