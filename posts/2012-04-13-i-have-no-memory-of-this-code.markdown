<div class="center">
<img src="/images/I_have_no_memory_of_this_code.png"
    width="450" height="554"
    alt="I have no memory of this code"
    class="fullscreen" />
</div>

Yes, I already shared this on Google+, but tineye said he can't find that image
anywhere else, and as I can't be sure I'll never abandon my G+ (or worse yet,
Google abandon it) I decided it's better to add some redundancy and post it
here, too.
