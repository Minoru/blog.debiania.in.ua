Personal productivity is all about finding things that work for *you*. In
today's post, I'd like to highlight a couple of tricks that I've been using for
the last 7 years, yet don't see mentioned as much as some other stuff, such as
Pomodoros or [two-minute rule][gtd-two-minute-rule]. Perhaps these tricks will
work for you, too.

# The Circle

No matter what system you employ to organize your tasks, it probably boils down
to a list of actions in the end. The Circle is a simple system of pictograms
that you use to track the status of your to-do items. [The full
description][the-circle] runs up to a few pages, but the essence of it can be
captured with a single image:

<div class="center">
<img src="/images/the_circle_system_redux-769px.jpg"
    sizes="(min-width: 769px) 35rem, 100vw"
    srcset="/images/the_circle_system_redux-769px.jpg 1x,
            /images/the_circle_system_redux-1538px.jpg 2x,
            /images/the_circle_system_redux-2307px.jpg 3x,
            /images/the_circle_system_redux-3395px.jpg 4x"
    alt="Summary of The Circle system"
    class="bleed" />
</div>

Original post also suggests some extensions, so go check it out. If you happen
to read Russian, Lifehacker.ru has [a nice summary][the-circle-lifehacker] too.

The Circle system became such an essential part of me that the circle became my
default list marker. (Other people seem to prefer dashes.)

# Don't break the chain

You probably have a task that you have to perform day after day, be it an
evening run or writing 300 words for your novel. I review English words using
Anki. But even though I know it's good for me, I still don't always feel like
doing the work. On days like that, I look at this graph:

<div class="center">
<img src="/images/don-t-break-the-chain-anki-769px.png"
    sizes="(min-width: 769px) 35rem, 100vw"
    srcset="/images/don-t-break-the-chain-anki-769px.png 1x,
            /images/don-t-break-the-chain-anki-1216px.png 2x"
    alt="My Anki review graph for the last 30 days"
    class="bleed" />
</div>

It shows how many words I reviewed in the last 30 days. The bars in the graph
form a chain. My life goal is to not let that chain break. (I already did,
though. Multiple times. But as Churchill said, success consists of going from
failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. I still feel enthusiastic.)

The chain idea comes from [this Lifehacker article][don-t-break-the-chain],
which says a stand-up comedian Jerry Seinfeld used the same approach to write
jokes. He had a big calendar on his wall and crossed the days out when he wrote.
Isn't that inspiring? Couldn't you just do the same?

Of course you could. And can. And should. And will. Won't you? Happy working!
