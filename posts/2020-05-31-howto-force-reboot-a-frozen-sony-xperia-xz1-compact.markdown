A friend's Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact just froze while charging: the screen stayed
on, but the phone didn't react to tapping or button presses. Holding down the
*Power* button didn't do anything either.

To force the phone to reboot, I pressed *Volume Up* and *Power* buttons
simultaneously for about 5 seconds. Some sources say I should've pressed *Volume
Down*, but that didn't work, prompting this post.
