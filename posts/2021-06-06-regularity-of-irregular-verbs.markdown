In all English classes that I took, irregular verbs were presented as a long
table of wildly different words to memorize. For years, I did not question this
approach. Why should have I? These verbs are called *irregular* for a reason;
there are no hard and fast rules about them.

Or so I thought. As I doubled down on [Anki][anki] reviews and committed all the
words to memory, there was this nagging feelingâ€¦ Until I realized a few days ago
that there *are* certain similarities, certain rules by which irregular verbs
are formed. They can be grouped into smaller, neater tables where everything is
simple!

I wanted to write a blog post about that grouping, but it turns out [someone
already did it][grouping]. So I'm sharing this in hope that more English
learners will discover this technique, and it will cut down on the amount of
rote they have to do (with Anki, of course!)
