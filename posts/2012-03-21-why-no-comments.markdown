title: Why no comments?

description: My blog doesn’t have comments because they’re often negative,
    people use them to ask for help, and we have better places for discussions
    anyway.

_**Summary**: discussions are often too negative, and when they're not, we still
have better places for them._

**Discussions on the Internet often are negative**. Widespread Internet access
gave some people confidence that they can do whatever they want, even have fun
at the expense of others. It's bitter when that kind of people are around, it's
pointless to talk to them, so I just cut communications off (though not
entirely—you can still read my entries, right?)

**People misuse them**. Comments are often useful: they contain typo
corrections, suggestions, new ideas etc. But just as often, feedback degrades
into helping forum, offtopic, or flame war, and *that* is definitely not what
comments are for. Which brings me right to the next point.

**We have better places for discussions**. Hacker News, Reddit, Google+,
whatever—just use what you like. Come here to read the entry and then go spread
the word. After all, search engines are the entry gates to the Internet now. It
doesn't matter anymore if you comment on my article here or elsewhere—your
feedback still can be found.

And that's all there is to it.
