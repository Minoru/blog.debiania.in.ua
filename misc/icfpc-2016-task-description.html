href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origami">Origami</a></span>s
are artistic objects created by folding square papers into shapes,
without cutting or glueing. Origami also refers to the act of creating
such objects.</div><div class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></div><div
class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Origami has been practiced for a long,
long time in Japan, and is now popular worldwide. But few are aware of
spiritual powers of origami. They offer protection from disasters such
as earthquakes,&nbsp;plagues&nbsp;and server failures<span class="c2">.
Now, we want to enhance the Big Buddha Statue of Nara, by offering
enchanted origamis to the Buddha. Origami silhouettes of special
meanings are described in the Kojiki, an ancient scroll, but how to fold
them is lost knowledge.</span></div><div class="c0 c1"><span
class="c2"></span></div><div class="c0"><span
class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we are now in the 21st century of
industry 4.0, big data, and artificial intelligence, we employ drone
geishas to fold origamis. Your task is to recover the folds, each in
form of a mapping from a square of paper to a special silhouette, so
that the drone geishas can be programmed to fold the ancient origamis
described in the Kojiki.</span></div><div class="c0 c1"><span
class="c2"></span></div><div class="c0"><span
class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make matters worse, the very act of
folding origamis using drone geishas draws The Singularity near, that
clouds everything (also known as IoT) and makes it impossible to see the
future. In preparation for this, we need to find out more powerful
origami shapes that were not even predicted in the Kojiki. We need help
from all of you here; you are all hardworking programmers, so those
origami shapes that are insoluble by most of you must hold the strongest
power.</span></div><div class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></div><div
class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We live in a two-dimensional world, so
only planar origamis are considered. As long as the origami is a valid
two-dimensional mapping, it is allowed to specify <span
class="c17">impossible</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;folds, that require
papers to penetrate each other. Never mind, one of geisha's jobs is to
warp the reality into fourth dimension.</span></div><div class="c0

Remark</span></h1><div class="c0">In our coordinate system, the <span

in the form <span class="c23">a/b,c/d</span>, where the numerators <span
class="c23">a</span>, <span class="c23">c</span>&nbsp;are integers and
the denominators <span class="c23">b</span>, <span
class="c23">d</span>&nbsp;are positive integers. The <span
class="c23">/</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and the denominator may be
abbreviated when the denominator is equal to 1. Fractions may be
reducible.</span></div><div class="c0"><span
class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Often we treat polygons and edges as sets
of points. In such cases the boundaries are inclusive. That is, a
polygon seen as a set of points includes its edges and vertices; an edge
as a set includes its two vertices.</span></div><div class="c0 c1"><span
class="c2"></span></div><div class="c0 c12">The size of a problem file
or a solution file is defined by the number of non-whitespace ASCII
characters in it. This is to avoid the issue of newline-code differences

teams that submitted a perfect solution, plus 1. The problem-setting

its solution. Remember, you cannot submit a solution to your own
problems.</span></div><div class="c0 c1"><span

when 39 teams submitted a perfect solution to a 1000-bytes problem, the
problem-setting team will earn <span style="font-family: &quot;courier

25.0</span> points.</span></div><div class="c0 c1"><span
