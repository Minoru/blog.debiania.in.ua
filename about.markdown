# About

Hello,

My name is Alexander Batischev. In 2015, I received my Master's degree in
Computer Science from Kyiv Polytechnic Institute, Ukraine. I'm fond of
listening to rock music (Pink Floyd, Nightwish, Manowar and Dream Theater are
my favourite bands), reading science fiction and hacking free software.

I'm the owner of [PGP key 0x356961a20c8bfd03][pgp]. If you ever [mail
me][email], I'd appreciate it if you make a digital signature (or better yet,
encrypt the message). I also have [an old key, 0x0a1d7d827b52fb07][pgp-old],
that dates back to the days when I tried PGP software for the first time.
I lost its revocation certificate, so please just ignore it.

<div class="center">~ * ~</div>

I started [blogging](http://debiania.blogspot.com) back in 2008, a few weeks
after I installed Debian (hence the blog's name). I kept my posts as purely
technical as possible, with rare exceptions for Linus' birthday and the like ☺
At the end of 2011 I suddenly realized that I don't like Blogspot anymore
([here's why — in Russian][why-migrate]). So I bought a domain name, rented
some hosting, mastered basics of [Hakyll](http://github.com/jaspervdj/hakyll)
and created new Debiania, the site you're reading right now.

Goals are the same — keep posting tech-related entries, not just about Debian,
but programming and CS overall as well. I don't think Google will ever delete
my old blog, but just in case, [here's][archive] a browseable copy, created as
described [here][httrack_recipe].

New Debiania has much simpler interface, mostly inspired by blogs of [Edward Z.
Yang](http://blog.ezyang.com) and [James Hague](http://prog21.dadgum.com).  I
also made two decisions about blogging itself: to [abandon comments][comments]
and to post entries in English alongside Russian ones. Hopefully the result
will still be useful to you.

In case you're interested in giving me a job, [here's my résumé][resume].

To make the job a bit easier for Daniel Graystone (and, undoubtedly, for Big
Brother as well), here's a list of other corners of the Internet where one can
find me self-expressing:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/Minoru)
* [BNW](https://bnw.im/u/minoru)
* [Google Plus](https://plus.google.com/112065341571031957772/posts)
* [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46952552-alexander)
* and last but not least, StackExchange network:

    <a href="http://stackexchange.com/users/157366/alexander-batischev"><img src="/images/stackexchange-flair.png" width="208" height="58" alt="profile for Alexander Batischev on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites" title="profile for Alexander Batischev on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites" /></a>

    <!-- That's right: the flair is mirrored to my site. There's no need for
    StackExchange to know that you're reading my blog.

    Also, this almost certainly speeds things up as your browser doesn't have
    to open another HTTPS connection. -->

There are also sites where I was present at some point in time, but which
I do not use anymore:

* [Juick.com](http://juick.com/Minoru) — I kept a microblog there for some
  time, but then site politics changed, and I switched into comments-only mode.
  Later on, when XMPP network made S2S encryption mandatory, juick.com
  became unaccessible (they didn't turn the encryption on), so I stopped
  visiting it altogether. In case it ever closes down, there is [a browseable
  archive of all my posts][juick-archive].

I also hang out on the Freenode occasionally under the nickname
of—surprise!—Minoru. I employ OTR with an opportunistic policy, so I will
perfectly understand it if you say "hello" and then go mute for half a minute,
waiting for connection to establish.

If you see someone with my name or nickname or avatar on some other resource,
that's most probably just an impostor. Ignore him.

See ya!
