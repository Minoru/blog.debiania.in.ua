Hello,

my name is Alexander Batischev. I'm a student at Kiev Polytechnic Institute
(Ukraine) where I'm studying computer science. I'm fond of listening to rock
music (Pink Floyd, Nightwish, Manowar and Dream Theater are my favourite bands)
and reading sci-fi books.

I'm the owner of [PGP key 0x356961a20c8bfd03][pgp]. If you ever [mail
me][email], I'd appreciate it if you make a digital signature.

<center style="font-size: small;">~ * ~</center>

I started [blogging](http://debiania.blogspot.com) back in 2008, a few weeks
after I installed Debian (hence the name). I kept my blog entries as purely
technical as possible, with rare exclusions for Linus' birthday and the like ☺
At the end of 2011 I suddenly realized that I don't like Blogspot anymore. They
once had comments system broken for a month, and the other time my code
listings went all messed up.  So I just bought a domain name, rented some
hosting, mastered basics of [Hakyll](http://github.com/jaspervdj/hakyll) and
created new Debiania, the site you're reading right now.

Goals are the same — keep posting tech-related entries, not only about Debian,
but also about programming and CS overall. I don't think Blogger will ever
delete my old blog, but just in case, [here][archive]'s a browseable copy,
created as described [here][httrack_recipe].

New Debiania has much simpler interface which is mostly inspired by [Edward Z.
Yang](http://blog.ezyang.com)'s and [James Hague](http://prog21.dadgum.com)'s
blogs. I also made two decisions about blogging itself: to [abandon
commenting][comments] and to post articles in English alongside with Russian
ones. Hope it still can be useful to you.

See you!
