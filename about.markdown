# About

Hello,

my name is Alexander Batischev. I'm a student at Kyiv Polytechnic Institute,
Ukraine, where I'm studying computer science. I'm fond of listening to rock
music (Pink Floyd, Nightwish, Manowar and Dream Theater are my favourite bands)
and reading sci-fi books.

I'm the owner of [PGP key 0x356961a20c8bfd03][pgp]. If you ever [mail
me][email], I'd appreciate it if you make a digital signature (or better yet,
encrypt the message).

I started [blogging](http://debiania.blogspot.com) back in 2008, a few weeks
after I installed Debian (hence the blog's name). I kept my posts as purely
technical as possible, with rare exceptions for Linus' birthday and the like ☺
At the end of 2011 I suddenly realized that I don't like Blogspot anymore
([here's why — in Russian][why-migrate]). So I just bought a domain name,
rented some hosting, mastered basics of
[Hakyll](http://github.com/jaspervdj/hakyll) and created new Debiania, the site
you're reading right now.

Goals are the same — keep posting tech-related entries, not just about Debian,
but about programming and CS overall, too. I don't think Google will ever
delete my old blog, but just in case, [here][archive]'s a browseable copy,
created as described [here][httrack_recipe].

New Debiania has much simpler interface, mostly inspired by blogs of [Edward Z.
Yang](http://blog.ezyang.com) and [James Hague](http://prog21.dadgum.com).  I
also made two decisions about blogging itself: to [abandon
commenting][comments] and to post entries in English alongside with Russian
ones. Hopefully the result will still be useful to you.

In case you're interested in giving me a job, [here's my résumé][resume].

See ya!
