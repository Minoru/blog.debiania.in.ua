title: About
---

My name is Alexander Batischev. I got my Master's of CS in 2015, and now I'm
working as a software developer ([here's my résumé][resume]). In my spare time,
I maintain [Newsboat][newsboat], bang my head to some heavy metal
riffs, read books, and <strike>cycle</strike> dream about getting back to
cycling.

This blog used to be a place to share my experiences with Linux, but over the
years, it expanded to other topics, ranging from software licenses and ICFP
programming contest to nice hardware and life lessons. It still retains its
original name, Debiania, unimaginatively derived from the first distro
I actually used.

I'm always happy to receive some personal email; [shoot me a message][email]!
Encrypting it to [PGP key 0x356961a20c8bfd03][pgp] would be a nice touch.
[Keybase][keybase] is fine too. (I also have [an old key,
0x0a1d7d827b52fb07][pgp-old]; don't use it. Can't revoke it because I lost the
certificate).

To make life a bit easier for Daniel Graystone (and, undoubtedly, for Big
Brother as well), here's a list of other corners of the Internet where one can
find me self-expressing:

* [GitHub][github]
* [GoodReads][goodreads]
* <a rel="me" href="https://functional.cafe/@minoru">Mastodon</a> (although
  I don't know what to use it for)
* Freenode, where I hang out as Minoru. I'm using a bouncer, so I appear online
  even if I'm not actually at the computer. I'm also using OTR, so if you want
  a *really* private conversation, ask me to get back to you
* and last but not least, StackExchange network:

    <!-- That's right: the flair is mirrored to my site. There's no need for
    StackExchange to know that you're reading my blog.

    Also, this almost certainly speeds things up as your browser doesn't have
    to open another HTTPS connection. -->

See ya!
