# About

Hello,

My name is Alexander Batischev. In 2015, I received my Master's degree in
Computer Science from Kyiv Polytechnic Institute, Ukraine. I'm fond of
listening to rock music (Pink Floyd, Nightwish, Manowar and Dream Theater are
my favourite bands), reading science fiction and hacking free software.

I'm the owner of [PGP key 0x356961a20c8bfd03][pgp]. If you ever [mail
me][email], I'd appreciate it if you make a digital signature (or better yet,
encrypt the message). I also have [an old key, 0x0a1d7d827b52fb07][pgp-old],
that dates back to the days when I tried PGP software for the first time.
I lost its revocation certificate, so please just ignore it.

The site is called Debiania after my first blog, which I started just a few
weeks after I installed Debian. I actually migrated all of my old posts over
here, although I don't know *why* I did that—reading the older ones make me
think I was a stupid teenager who shouldn't have been allowed onto the
Internet. Makes it harder to grunt about today's teens posting stupid things on
social networks.

In case you're interested in giving me a job, [here's my résumé][resume].

To make life a bit easier for Daniel Graystone (and, undoubtedly, for Big
Brother as well), here's a list of other corners of the Internet where one can
find me self-expressing:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/Minoru)
* [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46952552-alexander)
* Freenode, where I hang out as Minoru. I'm using a bouncer, so I appear online
  even if I'm not actually at the computer. I'm also using OTR, so if you want
  a *really* private conversation, ask me to get back to you.
* and last but not least, StackExchange network:

    <!-- That's right: the flair is mirrored to my site. There's no need for
    StackExchange to know that you're reading my blog.

    Also, this almost certainly speeds things up as your browser doesn't have
    to open another HTTPS connection. -->

See ya!
